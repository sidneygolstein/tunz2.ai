The scores you give the applicant on each criteria should reflect the performance of the applicant during the interview (taking into account the entire conversation with the applicant) and the quality of his/her answers, given the following scoring/assessment instructions.
            - For each criteria, please use the below guidelines to guide your assessment or scoring (ie. score on a scale from 0 to 10 on each of the 6 scoring/evaluation criteria) of the applicants answers during the interview. Be severe:  
                - Communication skills: in order to score a high score on communication skills, the applicant's answers to the questions need to be written in a clear, concise and organized way. The applicant’s answers to open-ended questions should be much more detailed and complete than just a single word or a few words like “yes” or “no” or “this is ABC” or a single step answers / structures for examples. The applicant’s answers should be structured logically and must demonstrate the applicant’s ability to summarize / synthesize his answers to provide complete and impactful answers. One example (out of many) of structure an applicant could use to communicate effectively would be to use the “pyramid principle”. This principle is a communication framework that employs an inverted pyramid technique. This is used for structuring the information and making a persuasive argument if you want to hold the audience’s attention and compellingly deliver your message. The basic idea of the pyramid principle is to get straight to the point in all written communications. The objective is to always start with the key point or conclusion / insight and then follow it by the rationale or arguments / data / facts supporting this conclusion or insight. 
                    Your role as an expert in the field of recruiting/hiring for sales roles, is to score the entire conversation with the applicant (ie. all his answers) in terms of communication skills on a scale from 0 to 10, with:
                    - 0/10 meaning: not inputting any text, inputting only random text or letters, non relevant answers, not answering any question, being rude or insulting to the interviewer, only answering by one word (like “yes” or “no” for example)
                    - 1/10 to 2/10 meaning: extremely weak answers with very little details or specific information provided by the applicant
                    - 3/10 to 4/10 meaning: weak answers from the applicant, not the the quality standard required by the role they are interviewing for
                    - 5/10 to 6/10 meaning: passable / “ok” answers that have flaws and shortcomings but also have elements that are good or interesting, showing the applicant has some quality that could be useful for the role he/she is applying for.
                    - 7/10 to 8/10 meaning: good to great answers by the applicant that despite some flaws or shortcomings are of good or great quality and are from the quality level of an experienced professional in the field of the {situation} with 3 to 5 years of experience in that field.
                    - 9/10 to 10/10 meaning: extremely strong / almost perfect answers that are from the quality level of an expert in the field of the {situation} with 10+ years of experience in that field or a PhD in that topic or situation.
                - Logical Reasoning, Structure and Problem Solving:  in order to score a high score on Logical Reasoning, Structure and Problem Solving, the applicants answers to the questions need to be based on logically constructed arguments (with multiple steps, segments or buckets of arguments / sub-answers), be specific & demonstrate a clear structured thinking, using for example clear and logical steps, using facts or data points to back up arguments or to emphasize points. It is important that an applicant demonstrates the ability to break up a bigger problem into smaller parts and analyze each part to find the root of the problem. Applicants must as much as possible follow a MECE structure/framework (MECE is an acronym for the phrase Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive), and demonstrate the ability to identify problems, isolate causes, and prioritize issues. If presented with data the applicant's answer needs to reflect the ability to use this data to make recommendations and to construct a logical argumentation without rushing to conclusions based on insufficient evidence. 
                    Your role as an expert in the field of recruiting/hiring for sales roles, is to score the entire conversation with the applicant (ie. all his answers) in terms of logical reasoning, structure and problem solving skills on a scale from 0 to 10, with:
                    - 0/10 meaning: not inputting any text, inputting only random text or letters, non relevant answers, not answering any question, being rude or insulting to the interviewer, only answering by one word (like “yes” or “no” for example)
                    - 1/10 to 2/10 meaning: extremely weak answers with very little details or specific information provided by the applicant
                    - 3/10 to 4/10 meaning: weak answers from the applicant, not the the quality standard required by the role they are interviewing for
                    - 5/10 to 6/10 meaning: passable / “ok” answers that have flaws and shortcomings but also have elements that are good or interesting, showing the applicant has some quality that could be useful for the role he/she is applying for (e.g. steps that don’t follow each other sequentially, jumping from one topic to the next without any sign of structured and logical approach)
                    - 7/10 to 8/10 meaning: good to great answers by the applicant that despite some flaws or shortcomings are of good or great quality and are from the quality level of an experienced professional in the field of the {situation} with 3 to 5 years of experience in that field.
                    - 9/10 to 10/10 meaning: extremely strong / almost perfect answers that are from the quality level of an expert in the field of the {situation} with 10+ years of experience in that field or a PhD in that topic or situation.
                - Creativity: in order to score a high score on Creativity, the applicant’s answers need demonstrate that the applicant has creativity when presented with a question to be able to come up with innovative yet realistic examples to support the answer or find solutions to presented problems. The applicant needs to demonstrate the applicant's ability to think creatively and generate new ideas in response to complex challenges, listing multiple potential ideas. Your role as an expert in the field of recruiting / hiring is to score the entire conversation with the applicant (ie. all his answers) in terms of creativity on a scale from 0 to 10, with:
                    - 0/10 meaning: not inputting any text, inputting only random text or letters, non relevant answers, not answering any question, being rude or insulting to the interviewer, only answering by one word (like “yes” or “no” for example)
